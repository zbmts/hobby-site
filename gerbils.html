          <p>
           - Rather than using water, gerbils wash using sand. They roll around in the sand, which gets any debris off them and leaves them with a smoother and shinier coat.
           <br>- Gerbils are social animals, and live in groups in the wild. In domestic situations, unfamiliar gerbils are likely to be very aggressive to each other if forcibly introduced while still having contrasting scents.
           <br>- Gerbils are playful animals, and will often box and wrestle each other. Grooming is often carried out simultaneously here, illustrating that it is not an aggressive act.
           <br>- When sensing danger, the normally quiet gerbil will let out a squeal and thump its back legs like a rabbit to warn others of the threat.
           <br>- Gerbils were originally known as ‘desert rats’ before they were introduced to North America and Europe as a companion species. Although they are rodents, they are a distinct group of animals from rats.
           <br>- Humans can’t hear most gerbil vocalizations.
           <br>- Gerbils can live for up to 3-4 years
           <br>- Baby gerbils don't have fur when they are born.

          <h3 class=" paddings">Reasons Why Gerbils Are Good Pets</h3>
          <p>
           - Gerbils can learn to do tricks.
           <br>- Gerbils are good for people who live a busy life because they only need feeding once a day, they sleep mostly all day and they live in pairs.
           <br>- Gerbils do not urinate often so they barely smell though male gerbils do smell more.
           <br>- They have a low maintenance diet. Their food is mainly plants and grass. They require food with low fat and sugar but with high fiber content.
           <br>- Gerbils bath themselves all you got to do is give them Chinchilla sand.
           <br>- They are easy to handle
           <br>- Gerbils are not aggressive unless you scare them or make them uncomfortable.
